Dockerfile_presta1614_ubuntu
includes mysql

todo:

presta has internal provisioning or memcasheD this can be scripted into the initial setup here when multicontainer mode is enabled with docker

this Dockerfile is configured to work easily on Amazon Web Services


else..

four isolated machine images in deploymeny cluster-
memchacheD, mysql, ububtu/prestashop, monitoring and deployment management instance

good approach? we'll see..
